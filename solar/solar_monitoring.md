Monitoring the solar power system


## Charge controller

Lumiax Magic Series 

https://www.lumiax.com/kindeditor/attached/file/User%20Manuals/Magic%20series/Magic%20series%20User%20Manual-MF.pdf

has a RS485 port with RJ11 interface controller. We need to look at this.

## Independent sensor nodes

using INA219 / INA260 breakout

### Things Uno - Arduino

exists - code is in 

https://github.com/ITU-DASYALab/roof/tree/main/solar/ina

### Lopy - micropython

Start with IoT course guides:

https://github.com/ITU-DASYALab/IoT_course/blob/main/guides/archive/gettingStartedWithPycom.md

https://github.com/ITU-DASYALab/IoT_course/blob/main/guides/archive/lopyLoRa%26TTN.md

and pycom documentation:

https://docs.pycom.io/

Note: the compnay no longer exists, so how long this will be there is anybody's guess ...



Steps:

  * hello world
  * read I2C sensors
  * LoRa / TTN
